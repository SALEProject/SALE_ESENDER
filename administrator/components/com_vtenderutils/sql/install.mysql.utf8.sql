It complements the national financing mode of data collection as result of the ESFRI process by keeping its centrifugal forces in bounds. \r\n\r\nIt will keep up our excellence in service provision as well as in science by: \r\n1. Fostering the culture of cooperation between designers and users of SHARE by organizing user conferences, offering specialized training courses for users and interviewers, expanding web services and developing standards and procedures within the network that will make more efficient use of the research infrastructure. \r\n2. Improving the multinational services for users in EU member countries, associated countries and third countries by a more efficient centralized data base management that will provide detailed synopses and concordances across member countries. We will coordinate this work with our sister surveys in the UK, US, China, India, Japan, Korea and Thailand, thereby providing a platform for global access to ageing data. \r\n3.

(3, 2, 'While access to anonymous official micro-data for researchers is still uneven both at national and at European level, access to highly detailed and sensitive micro-data is now increasingly on the agenda. Different member states have substantially different outcomes for research access to Official data, and the issue is not just efficiency, but real harm to the contribution of the social sciences to democracy in an information society. Therefore the primary impact of this application is to prepare the essential relationships and build trust, common view and agreements on standards between the European Statistical System led by Eurostat, other stakeholders as the Central banks, the Data Archives European network (CESSDA) and the researchers who are the final users; from access as a postcode lottery, to an integrated model where the best solutions for access are available irrespective of national boundaries and are flexible enough to fit national arrangements.

How can I access them?) for the researchers, to be linked to the CESSDA portal where NSIs metadata could be harvested when not available through the CESSDA archives still providing access to official micro-data; \r\nd) immediately enhancing access to official data making European datasets more useable (metadata, routines) and supporting foreign researchers transnational access both on site and through remote access system to countries official micro-data. \r\n\r\nClose coordination with the European Statistical System discussions and initiatives as well as with on-going and future related projects is developed to ensure maximum synergy and incorporation of outputs.', 1),
(5, 3, 'At the core of this research proposal is the aim of reconstructing and understanding the nature, exact trajectories, mechanisms and implications of cross-cultural contact and transfers between Europeans and the native people of the Americas, focusing on, but not limited to, the Nahuatl-speaking zone of central Mexico. A major innovation of this project is to study this process of cross-cultural communication in its full historical depth, through the colonial and postcolonial eras up to the present day and encompassing different stages and types of contact. The meticulous and cross-disciplinary study of an extensive body of texts in Nahuatl (Aztec) and Spanish, complemented by present-day ethnolinguistic data, will make it possible to deduce and understand patterns across time and space in ways novel to existing scholarship, embracing both micro- and macroregional trends.', 0),
(6, 3, 'The proposed research starts with identifying transfers in language, studied systematically through the creation of extensive databases, but leads to exploring the substance of cross-cultural transfer and the essence of developments, becoming a fundamental way of studying culture and its transformations. Thus, an important aim is the correlation of language phenomena with more general contact-induced culture change, including especially evolving forms of political, social and municipal organization in the native world, where the change is more salient. Breaking existing disciplinary boundaries in the humanities, the project embraces both indigenous and European perspectives, assuming that the innovation of studying both sides in a single framework and in the proposed time span is particularly promising in dealing with a notably two-sided, prolonged historical process. The complementary lines of research, native and Spanish, are expected to highlight and make understandable factors underlying and facilitating cultural convergence between them in different aspects of colonial life and beyond.', 1),
(7, 4, 'Pharaonic Egypt is commonly known for its pyramids and tomb treasures. The present knowledge of Egyptian everyday life and social structures derives mostly from mortuary records associated with the upper classes, whereas traces of ordinary life from domestic sites are generally disregarded. Settlement archaeology in Egypt and Nubia (Ancient North Sudan) is still in its infancy; it is timely to strengthen this field. Responsible for the pottery at three major settlement sites (Abydos and Elephantine in Egypt; Sai Island in Sudan), the PI is in a unique position to co-ordinate a research project on settlement patterns in Northeast Africa of the 2nd millennium BC based on the detailed analysis of material remains. The selected case studies situated across ancient and modern borders and of diverse environmental and cultural preconditions, show very similar archaeological remains. Up to now, no attempt has been made to explain this situation in detail.', 0),
(8, 4, 'The focus of the project is the well-preserved, only partially explored site of Sai Island, seemingly an Egyptian microcosm in New Kingdom Upper Nubia. Little time is left to conduct the requisite large-scale archaeology as Sai is endangered by the planned high dam of Dal. With the application of micro-archaeology we will introduce an approach that is new in Egyptian settlement archaeology. Our interdisciplinary research will result in novel insights into (a) multifaceted lives on Sai at a micro-spatial level and (b) domestic life in 2nd millennium BC Egypt and Nubia from a macroscopic view. The present understanding of the political situation in Upper Nubia during the New Kingdom as based on written records will be significantly enlarged by the envisaged approach. Furthermore, in reconstructing Sai Island as home away from home, the project presents a showcase study of what we can learn about acculturation and adaptation from ancient cultures, in this case from the coexistence of Egyptians and Nubians.', 1),

An independent European team of academic researchers assesses the impact of activities in 10 science centres, 10 events and 10 cities, by selecting with neutrality among the PLACES participants (around 70 cities).

(11, 6, 'All plant cells, maintain a pH gradient across the vacuolar membrane throughout their life. An acidic vacuolar environment is necessary for activation of many vacuolar functions, while a neutral environment is required for most cytoplasmic functions. The mechanisms by which pH-homeostasis is achieved are still not clear. In petunia, as in all coloured flowers, the vacuole is the place of storage for the anthocyanin pigments. \r\n\r\nAnthocyanins behave as pH indicators and allow one to recognize mutants by their blue flower colour. In this way we identified 7 distinct PH loci in petunia that control vacuolar pH in the flower petals. We recently isolated PH4 and PH3 and found that they encode transcription factors, which presumably control the activity of downstream genes and proteins. Interestingly, we found that AN1, AN2 and AN11, transcription activators of the anthocyanin pathway, are also involved in pH regulation. To understand the biochemical mechanisms by which pH is regulated, we isolated a pool of target genes/proteins controlled by these regulatory PH and AN genes by cDNA-AFLP and microarray analysis.

To demonstrate the interdisciplinary character of this approach we plan to apply this approach to two different applications related to molecular system biology and molecular materials science.
